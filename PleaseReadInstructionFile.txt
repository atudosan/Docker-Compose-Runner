Hello, Thank you for reviewing my repository
In order to run my Docker-Compose file you need to have Docker install in you machine.
Then open terminal right there where you pull this file and run following command: docker-compose up
This will run 4 images:
1. selenium hub
2. selenium chrome
3. selenium firefox
4. and my image atudosan/selenium-docker  

If you have any question about my project please don't hesitate to contact me
